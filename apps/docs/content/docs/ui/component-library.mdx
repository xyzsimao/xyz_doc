## Overview

Fumadocs UI maintains support for both **Base UI** and **Radix UI**, while it uses Radix UI by default.

The configuration may be different if you use Fumadocs CLI for customising components.

### Base UI

You can opt-in to use Base UI by replacing `xyzdoc-ui` with the `@fumadocs/base-ui` package:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependency": {
    "xyzdoc-ui": "npm:@fumadocs/base-ui@latest"
  }
}
```

For Fumadocs CLI, also configure it in your `cli.json` config:

```json title="cli.json"
{
  "uiLibrary": "base-ui"
}
```
